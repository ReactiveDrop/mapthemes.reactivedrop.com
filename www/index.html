<summary>How it works</summary>
<p>This website is intended as a source of inspiration for map makers who can't decide on a theme for their next map. It chooses a random adjective and/or noun from a list and shows you one of several pre-generated images associated with those words.</p>
<p>These <a href="images/">images</a> are generated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a>, an algorithm that allows a computer to hallucinate an image based on its knowledge of an extremely large set of labelled images.</p>
<p>The generation process was run on an NVIDIA T1000 with 8GB of VRAM and took about a minute for the first pass and about five minutes for the upscaling pass for each image.</p>
<p>This process took 3 months for the initial set of 21,810 images (10 variants of each combination of 51 adjectives and 41 nouns, plus 10 variants of each word alone with a two-word overlap between the lists) and started on July 26th 2023.</p>
<p>This page simply displays a random image from the set of thousands, along with the adjective and noun used in the prompt for the image.</p>
